Do you want to follow your teams on Twitter, but don't want all of the pre/post game coverage cluttering your feed? I do too. That's why I built Nothin But Scores.

Nothin But Scores is a collection of team dedicated Twitter accounts that will only post final scores for their team. Follow these accounts to get final scores, right in your Twitter feed.

See how it's built at [hanswustrack.com/projects/nothin-but-scores](https://hanswustrack.com/projects/nothin-but-scores/).
